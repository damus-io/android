/// `promise_assert` macro
///
/// This macro is designed to emulate the nature of immediate mode asynchronous code by repeatedly calling 
/// promise.ready() for a promise, sleeping for a short period of time, and repeating until the promise is ready.
///
/// Arguments:
/// - `$assertion_closure`: the assertion closure which takes two arguments: the actual result of the promise and
///   the expected value. This macro is used as an assertion closure to compare the actual and expected values.
/// - `$expected`: The expected value of type `T` that the promise's result is compared against.
/// - `$asserted_promise`: A `Promise<T>` that returns a value of type `T` when the promise is satisfied. This 
///   represents the asynchronous operation whose result will be tested.
///
